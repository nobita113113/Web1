    <section class="history">
      <h3>📜 History</h3>
      <p>
        Banh Mi originated during the French colonial period, when the French introduced the baguette to Vietnam.
        Vietnamese people adapted it with local ingredients such as pate, grilled or cold meats, pickled vegetables,
        fresh herbs, and chili, creating a unique version that is both simple and full of Vietnamese flavor.
